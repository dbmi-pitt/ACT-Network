## ACT Pre-Production Checklist
Prior to being connected to the ACT Production tier, sites connected to the Stage Tier must confirm the following items in the [ACT Pre-Production Checklist](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gss08lLkYKdiS0H9yjAhbn8-r0TvS2JYba3yyignboY/edit?usp=sharing). It is expected that sites will continue to cross items off as they are completed.

## Implementation Tasks (Previous guidance for reference only - dates no longer relevant)
The [Implementation Task Timeline](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UHdPfeOHFoAjAo7tHVsEMLQ7lMXhaYbieaK2ptagSXQ/edit?usp=sharing) highlights the various tasks that must be completed for onboarding, their suggested site functions, and estimated time to completion. This also includes an introduction to the smoke test query components and possible results.

## Helpful Resources
### ACT Onboarding Project
All onboarding sites are asked to keep their information up to date in the [ACT Onboarding JIRA Project](https://actnetwork.atlassian.net/projects/AOB/board). This project is used to monitor sites' statuses on the various technical and administrative tasks required to successfully onboard to the network. Sites are asked to update their information on a bi-weekly basis and create a ticket for any issues encountered.
