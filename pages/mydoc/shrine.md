## SHRINE Webclient Help Link
Did you know that you can customize the "Help" link in your local SHRINE webclient? 

If your sites has a co-branded ACT website (those of you who have launched ACT to local end users), we recommend you link to it in SHRINE. It may be helpful to end users if you point them to the "Technical Resources" page where they can find information on version updates and the data characterization summary. 

The link to this page on the national website is found [here](https://www.actnetwork.us/national/tech-resources-46EU-1429JJ.html) for reference. An instruction sheet for making this customization can be found [here](https://pitt.box.com/s/yfadiyhvhakd2tkka9geo2h4c9kiynq4).

## SHRINE 3.0.0 (New Webclient) Information

With this new webclient, researchers can expect:
* More streamlined and lightweight interface design
*	More intuitive for new end users
*	Preferred pathway for end users, although the legacy webclient will remain available for the time being
*	Sites are just starting to implement the new webclient. Please reach out to your local administrator to learn when your institution will adopt the new webclient.
