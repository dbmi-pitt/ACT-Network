## ACT Network Jira
The ACT Network Jira is used for sites to create and monitor tickets when an issue arises at their site. Tickets will be assigned to the appropriate personnel based on the issue. Sites are encouraged to submit tickets when an issue arises to ensure a prompt and thorough resolution process. 

The ACT Network uses a single user/site access model. One primary account from each site should have access to the ACT Network Jira Project. Click [here](https://actnetwork.atlassian.net/projects/ACT/summary) to access the site.
