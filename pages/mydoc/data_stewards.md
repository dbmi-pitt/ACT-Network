## ACT Usage Metrics

The monthly ACT Metrics collection survey is on [RedCap](https://www.ctsiredcap.pitt.edu/redcap/surveys/?s=JPTYEE8AEP).

**Who completes the survey?** Sites live with end users. Sites must complete the survey even if their number have not changed from the previous month.

**How often does the survey need completed?** Monthly, by the second Friday of each month to capture data for the previous month. The survey will be sent to the data steward mailing list each month as a reminder.

**What if I didn't submit a previous month's metrics?** If you have not submitted a prior month's metrics, feel free to fill out the survey as many times as necessary. When doing so, make sure you denote the appropriate month and date in the survey.

**How is this information used?** Data collected is used for executive committee and NCATS reporting purposes, but we are evaluating how best to share this information back to participating ACT sites.
